Changelog
=========

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v4.0.0...v5.0.0) (2022-05-13)

### Features

Feature: The <CKEditor> component contains the built-in watchdog feature.

Feature: The `onError()` callback will be called with two arguments. The first one will be an error object (as it was before the release 3+). A second argument is an object that contains two properties:

  * `{String} phase`: `'initialization'|'runtime'` - Informs when the error has occurred (during the editor/context initialization or after the initialization).
  * `{Boolean} willEditorRestart` - When `true`, it means that the editor component will restart itself.

    The `willEditorRestart` property will not appear when the error has occurred in the context feature.

## [4.0.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1) (2022-05-18)

### Bug fixes

* Synchronize the editor content after the editor is ready. Closes [#220](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/220). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/def7735c75821522a9a28b192f4166cca0c55dfb))


## [4.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0) (2022-04-12)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Due to introducing the lock mechanism for the `Editor#isReadOnly` property, the `<CKEditor>` component uses the new way of enabling the read-only mode in the editor. The component requires an instance of CKEditor 5 in version 34 or higher. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#10496](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10496).

### Other changes

* Aligned the `<CKEditor>` component API to use the new lock mechanism when enabling/disabling the read-only mode. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/5b45af9bc81dbf65fdc4b76eafbb6ca6916ff406))
* Bumped Karma test runner to v6.x. Closes [#210](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/210). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/38c25bf57b3e3dd5bf503366f9901076b9353602))


## [3.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v2.0.1...v3.0.0) (2022-03-17)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Upgraded the minimal versions of Node.js to `14.0.0` due to the end of LTS.

### Bug fixes

* Marked the editor instance `this.instance` as a raw object so that it will never be converted to a proxy. Closes [#203](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/203). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/05e2897e4274bfd584d60f02480634bff987ab8a))

### Other changes

* Updated the required version of Node.js to 14. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#10972](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10972). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/fd410eccc93d130fd6e50a1019915a3e0a2f2e67))


## [2.0.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2020-11-23)

### Bug fixes

* When using the `<CKEditor>` component with an unsupported version of Vue.js, the component will display an error. Closes [#170](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/170). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/300f301deeae9f8f6434c6a398c815aa3f6a0f91))


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.3...v2.0.0) (2020-11-20)

The CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor component is compatible with Vue.js 3+. For Vue.js 2.x, check the dedicated [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue2) component.


## [1.0.3](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3) (2020-09-22)

### Bug fixes

* The editor should not slow down with lots of content when using the integration. Closes [#153](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/153). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/df4410a077c5eed5b95533f26f28e88882af289d))

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* The reference to the CKEditor 5 instance previously available under the `instance` property of the component (data) is now private (`$_instance`). We recommend you use the [`ready`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/frameworks/vuejs.html#ready) component event to access the editor API instead.

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2) (2020-09-01)

### Bug fixes

* The `#input` event should be fired immediately despite being debounced to prevent race conditions. Closes [#149](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/149). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/c8ff4da551f51433398785c340c65031e63d332a))


## [1.0.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2019-12-05)

### Bug fixes

* Editor config defined in the component should not be mutable. Closes [#101](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/101). ([42651e3](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/42651e3))


## [1.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0) (2019-09-20)

### Bug fixes

* [`config.initialData`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_core_editor_editorconfig-EditorConfig.html#member-initialData) should be used to set the initial state of the editor instead of unsafe `innerHTML`. Closes [#51](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/51). ([950b49a](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/950b49a))

## [1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/compare/v1.0.0-beta.1...v1.0.0-beta.2) (2019-04-24)

### Bug fixes

* Improved performance when editing large content. Debounced the component `#input` event. Closes [#42](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/42). ([dfaee36](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/dfaee36))
* The data initialization should not break collaboration. Instead of using `editor.setData()`, the initial content is now set via `innerHTML` of the source element. Closes [#47](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/47). ([6f821fa](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/6f821fa))
